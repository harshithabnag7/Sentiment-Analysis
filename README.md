# Project Title: Sentiment-Analysis on Iphone Reviews

### :computer:  **Domain:**  

#### Natural Language Processing

### ðŸ“– **Skills Used:** 

#### Python, NLP, Stemming, Polarity, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, and Pandas.

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Project Overview:** 

This project involves cleaning and pre-processing 10,000+ iPhone reviews to ensure accuracy in analysis and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns or trends in the data and extracted insights from the data by performing data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, and Pandas.

### ðŸ’¡ **Results:**

 * Using techniques such as polarity, objectivity, the sentiment turned out to be positive.
 * Using VADER Model, the sentiment turned out to be Neutral.

### ðŸ“š Learnings:

 * **Tokenization:** Breaking down a sentence or text into individual words or tokens.
 * **Lemmatizing:** Reducing words to their base or root form to simplify analysis (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
 * **Stemming:** Trimming words to their core by removing prefixes or suffixes, used for basic normalization (e.g., "jumps" becomes "jump").
 * **VADER Model:**  A sentiment analysis tool Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner that gauges the emotional tone of text, especially useful for social media content.
 * The reason for the different sentiment results is that each method (polarity and objectivity vs. VADER) employs distinct ways to analyze and understand the sentiment of text. They might focus on different aspects, use varied sets of rules, and be trained on different types of data. So, the specific characteristics and nuances of the text you're analyzing can lead to varying interpretations of sentiment depending on the method used.

### :lock: Conclusion: 

Performed a sentiment analysis on the iPhone reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as polarity, objectivity, and VADER model and measured the sentiment of the iPhone reviews using a quantitative scale to determine the overall positive or negative sentiment.
